Feels like nowadays there is nothing but AI in the tech industry. I mean its cool to see the new toys. But is it just me that don't feel that excited with all the advancements? I mean I use LLM on a daily basis, however the level of code that LLM gives is honestly bad. The decisions that it makes sometimes is downright stupid.
I don't think this will be a problem for developers with certain level of experience but I wonder how this impacts newer developers. They will just be asking LLMs to generate code with no idea of whether that code is good or bad. This almost feels like it will make them lose touch on how actual programming is done.
Having said that, if used correctly LLM can be super beneficial to them. For example, researching about something is like ten times easier with LLMs, although you need to verify the details it produces eventually. For me, LLM is a great tool but it should be you, the developer, who ultimately has the final say. LLMs should be an extension of your brain, not the whole thing. If all you know is to ask and copy paste, you might as well just be an API who pulls the code from LLM to code editor.

I wonder how the newer developers of today will look like in 5 years, especially in country like Nepal, where is bar is already quite low for developers. How will the vibes be?


PS: I resisted the strong urge to ask ChatGPT rewrite this. lol.
